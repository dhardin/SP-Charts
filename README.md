#SP-Charts
=========
Module meant to be embedded in a content editor web part in MOSS 2007+ which allows for anyone with design access to create a custom chart dashboard.

#Dependencies
- jQuery UI (I was opting for Bootstrap or Foundation but that maybe a fork off of this project since I need to support MOSS 2007...quirks mode FTW)
- Html5shiv (allows for use of HTML5 elements in quirks mode for MOSS 2007)
- PIE (allows for CSS3 styling in quirks mode for MOSS 2007)
- Raphael Charts or D3...still deciding.
